# DSP-Speaker-Filter
Teensy DSP audio filter for external speakers


This is a version of the DSP filter designed for use in an external amplified speaker. Please visit https://gi1mic.github.io/ for information on how to setup your development environment and general information that may be helpful in this project.

Note I am using the Teensy audio shield to simplify audio in/out for this but the code does support using the AD & DAC to reduce costs. I have not tested it but should work fine. Please see the original project linked above for the audio connections should you go down this route.
