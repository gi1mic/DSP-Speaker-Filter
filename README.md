# DSP-Speaker-Filter
Teensy DSP audio filter for external speakers


This is a version of the DSP filter designed for use in an external amplified speaker.

I am using the Teensy audio shield to simplify audio in/out but the code support using the AD & DAC to reduce costs. I have not tested this but it should work. Please see the origional 19-dollar-DSP project for the audio connections if you go down this route.
